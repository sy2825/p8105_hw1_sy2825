Problem 1
=========

First, we Create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

-   A (length-10) character vector

-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1)

problem1_df = tibble(
  Random_Sample = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = Random_Sample > 2,
  vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "female", "female", "female"))
)
```
